## Previewing Your Changes in VSCode 
VSCode gives you the ability to control your editor in a number of ways. You can choose whether to open a pair of editor windows, or you can choose to open an editor window and a preview pane. For Markdown, this is an excellent way to see what the effects of your note-taking are, as you are writing.
